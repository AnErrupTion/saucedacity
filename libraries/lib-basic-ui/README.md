# lib-basic-ui and GenericUI

This library contains the GenericUI wrapper toolkit. This is largely going to be implemented around wxWidgets, more or less created in the style of wxWidgets too.

Right now, lib-basic-ui is purely Audacity's version. We intend to implement more of this in the future, in addition to bringing BasicUI over to the mix too.

More documentation is expected to arrive in a `doc/` folder or something. Documentation is a priority too, and this will mostly be done with Doxygen for now.

Currently, GenericUI isn't build with Saucedacity. GenericUI is virtually nothing at this point, and, in order to save time compiling, is not built.

Warning: some of this code is untested. If you see a bug, or if something doesn't look right, please file an issue under our issue tracker.
