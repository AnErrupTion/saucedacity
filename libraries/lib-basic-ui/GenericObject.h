 * The GenericObject class is a base class for every single object in
 * GenericUI. It mostly implements internal things for derived objects.
 *
 * Note that you will not be able to instantiate a GenericObject object itself.
 * The default constructor and destructor are deleted.

     *
     * This function adds a child object to the current object. Any resources
     * associated with the child object are now bound by the lifetime of the
     * parent.
     *
     * Deriving this member function further should be irrelevant. However,
     * some object types might require more than what the default GenericObject
     * implementation provides. In that case, there might be an overloaded
     * version of this function that you should use instead of this function.
     * In other cases, this function might throw an exception, requiring the
     * use of another (overloaded) function.
     *
     * **Exceptions**
     *
     * This function throws the following exceptions:
     *
     * **std::invalid_argument** - `child` is null.
     *
     * @param child The child object to add as a child.
     * @return Returns `*this` (for function chaining).

     * objects are still preserved and are not destroyed by removing them.
     *
     * When removing child objects, each child object is to be immediately
     * disassociated from its parent. From then on, the object is a
     * **standalone object** (an object that manages its own resources). The
     * parent is also no longer a parent itself since it doesn't have any

     * from another one.

     * current object end-of-life).

     * destruction, the aforementioned details are specific to GenericObject.

     * while adding their own (appropriate) functionality. For that, please
     * consult that class's documentation.
